PrimeNums

Name: Ali Rizwan

The code is designed to print the first 1000 primes. 
It does so by executing a loop that starts at 2 and tests to see if the given number is a prime. 
This test is completed by testing the divisibility of every number from 2 up until the number in question. 
If no numbers are divisible, then the code considers it prime and prints it.
